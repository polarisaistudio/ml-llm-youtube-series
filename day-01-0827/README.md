## 💻 Code Examples

### Quick Start: Traditional ML
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Data: house sizes and prices
X = np.array([[750], [900], [1200], [1500], [1800]])
y = np.array([150000, 180000, 240000, 300000, 360000])

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make prediction
new_house = np.array([[1650]])
predicted_price = model.predict(new_house)
print(f"Predicted price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")
```

### Quick Start: Modern AI (Conceptual)
```python
# Modern AI with OpenAI (requires API key)
import openai

client = openai.Client(api_key="your-key")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain ML simply"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 🎯 Today's Project: Email Spam Classifier

Build a complete spam detection system that:
1. Loads and preprocesses email data
2. Extracts features using TF-IDF
3. Trains multiple classifiers
4. Evaluates performance
5. Provides an interactive interface

**Expected outcome**: 95%+ accuracy spam detector!

## 📊 Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Traditional ML | Modern AI |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Data Type** | Structured (tables) | Unstructured (text, images) |
| **Feature Engineering** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Training Data** | Small-Medium | Large |
| **Interpretability** | High | Low |
| **Computation** | Low | High |
| **Use Cases** | Prediction, Classification | Generation, Understanding |

## 🚀 Running the Code

### Run the Main Demo
```bash
python code/demos/main_demo.py
```

This will:
- Train a house price prediction model
- Show traditional ML vs neural network comparison
- Display decision guidelines
- Save visualizations to `assets/images/`

### Start the Project
```bash
cd code/projects
python main.py  # Follow the project_instructions.md
```

## 🎨 Visualizations Generated

1. **Traditional ML Results**: Actual vs predicted house prices
2. **ML vs NN Comparison**: Performance with different data sizes
3. **Feature Importance**: What matters most in predictions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError**: Module not found
```bash
pip install -r code/projects/requirements.txt
```

**ValueError**: Data shape mismatch
- Check that your input data has the correct dimensions
- Use `.reshape(-1, 1)` for single feature data

**Low Accuracy**: Model performing poorly
- Ensure data is properly cleaned
- Try different algorithms
- Check for data imbalance
