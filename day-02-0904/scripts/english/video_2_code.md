# Video 2: Python Fundamentals for ML - Code Examples (15 minutes)

**Visual Assets Needed:**
- day-02-0904/assets/images/video/04_step_by_step.png
- Screen recordings of code execution
- Terminal/IDE setup demonstrations

## Opening (0:00-0:30)
[VISUAL: Split screen - code editor and terminal]

"Let's get hands-on with Python Fundamentals for ML. I'll show you two examples you can follow along with."

## Section 1: Setup & Environment (0:30-2:00)
[VISUAL: Screen recording of installation process]

"First, let's make sure your environment is ready..."

### Installation Commands:
```bash
# [SHOW ON SCREEN]
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

# Verification
python -c "import pandas; print('Setup successful!')"
```

[VISUAL: Show successful installation output]

## Section 2: Simple Example (2:00-7:00)
[VISUAL: day-02-0904/assets/images/video/04_step_by_step.png as background reference]

"Let's start with a simple example that demonstrates the core concept..."

```python
# [TYPE LIVE ON SCREEN]
# Simple Python Fundamentals for ML example
# CUSTOMIZE: Add topic-specific simple example
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Basic implementation
def simple_example():
    # Add your simple example here
    print(f"This is a placeholder - customize for Python Fundamentals for ML")
    return True

# Run example
result = simple_example()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

[VISUAL: Show code execution and output]

## Section 3: Real-World Example (7:00-12:00)
[VISUAL: Switch between code and architecture diagram]

"Now let's see how this works with real data..."

```python
# [TYPE LIVE ON SCREEN] 
# Realistic Python Fundamentals for ML example with real data
# CUSTOMIZE: Add topic-specific realistic example
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def realistic_example():
    # CUSTOMIZE: Add realistic example for Python Fundamentals for ML
    print(f"This is a placeholder - customize for Python Fundamentals for ML")
    
    # Include proper error handling
    try:
        # Your realistic implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        print("Common solutions: Check data format, verify imports")
    
    return None

# Run with error handling
result = realistic_example()
```

[VISUAL: Show results and explain output]

## Section 4: Troubleshooting Common Issues (12:00-14:30)
[VISUAL: day-02-0904/assets/images/video/07_common_mistakes.png]

"Here are the most common issues beginners face..."

[CUSTOMIZE: Add common errors and solutions]

## Closing (14:30-15:00)
"Next video: How to decide when to use this approach..."

## Production Notes:
- Use large font sizes (16pt minimum) for code
- Include error examples and how to fix them
- Provide GitHub repository link in description
- Show both successful and failed runs
