🚀 Day 2/40: Python Fundamentals for ML

Today's focus: The essential Python tools every ML practitioner needs.

🎯 Key Takeaways:

📊 NumPy - Efficient numerical computing
• Arrays are 50x faster than Python lists
• Built-in statistical functions
• Foundation for all ML libraries

📈 Pandas - Data manipulation made easy
• Load any data format (CSV, Excel, JSON)
• Clean and transform with one-liners
• Instant data insights with .describe()

🔧 Essential Patterns:
```python
# The ML data loading pattern
def load_and_prep(file):
    data = pd.read_csv(file)
    data = data.dropna()
    return data
```

💡 Beginner Tip: Start with small datasets (<1000 rows) to understand concepts before scaling up.

❌ Common Mistake: Not checking data types before processing. 
✅ Quick Fix: Always use `df.dtypes` first, then `pd.to_numeric()` to convert!

📚 Today's Practice:
1. Load any CSV file with Pandas
2. Calculate basic statistics with NumPy
3. Create a simple data preparation function

Tomorrow: Data Preprocessing - Turning messy data into ML-ready datasets!
